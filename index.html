            <h2>Description of AC Mirage</h2>
            <p>
                Assassin's Creed Mirage is a 2023 action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft Bordeaux and published by
                Ubisoft. The game is the thirteenth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series and the successor
                to 2020's Assassin's Creed Valhalla. While its historical timeframe precedes that of Valhalla, its
                modern-day framing story succeeds Valhalla's own. Set in 9th-century Baghdad during the Islamic Golden
                Age—in particular during the Anarchy at Samarra—the story follows Basim Ibn Ishaq (a character first
                introduced in Valhalla), a street thief who joins the Hidden Ones to fight for peace and liberty,
                against the Order of the Ancients,[b] who desire peace through control. The main narrative focuses on
                Basim's internal struggle between his duties as a Hidden One and his desire to uncover his mysterious
                past.
